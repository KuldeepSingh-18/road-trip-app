# Road Trip Planner App

![Road Trip App]

A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application for planning and managing road trips. This app allows users to create custom trip itineraries, visualize routes on a map, discover points of interest, and securely save their trip details.

## Features

*   **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionality.
*   **Trip Management**: Create, view, update, and delete personalized road trip plans.
*   **Interactive Maps**: Visualize your trip with map integration to see routes and waypoints.
*   **Points of Interest (POI)**: Discover and add local attractions, restaurants, and other locations to your itinerary.
*   **Persistent Storage**: Save trip data using a MongoDB database.
*   **Responsive Design**: A user-friendly interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
*   **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
*   **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
*   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing trip data.
*   **Mongoose**: MongoDB object data modeling (ODM) for Node.js.
*   **(Optional)** `bcrypt`: For password hashing and security.
*   **(Optional)** `jsonwebtoken`: For user authentication.

### Frontend
*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **React Router**: For client-side routing.
*   **(Optional)** **Axios**: For making API requests from the browser.
*   **(Optional)** **Mapping API**: (e.g., Google Maps API, Mapbox) for displaying interactive maps.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/KuldeepSingh-18/road-trip-app.git
    cd road-trip-app
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend**:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with your database connection details and other variables:
    ```sh
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/roadtripdb
    PORT=5000
    # For authentication
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```
    Start the backend server:
    ```sh
    node index.js
    ```
    The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend**:
    Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```
    Start the React development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Frontend Scripts

In the `frontend/` directory, you can run the following scripts, which are provided by Create React App:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.

## Deployment

Refer to the Create React App deployment documentation for information on how to deploy the frontend to a static server. You will also need to configure your backend for a production environment.
